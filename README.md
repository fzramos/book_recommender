# Book Recommendations Web App

## ChiCodes Final Project

Goal is to build register/login/db integration for app
COMPLETE

Next step is to get User recommendation form ready as well as book output
Users should be able to get book recs whether logged in or not
But only be able to save books to their list if they are signed in

Also should have a tab for searching books/genres (maybe do this first to get api working)
Use async await and fetch

Then work on integrating the csv using pandas.DataFrame.to_sql() into the database
